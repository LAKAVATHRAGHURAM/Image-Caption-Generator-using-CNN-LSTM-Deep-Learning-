# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator using CNN + LSTM

This project implements an AI-based Image Captioning model using deep learning. The system uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for extracting visual features from images and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for generating meaningful natural language captions.
